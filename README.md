based on:
Routify: https://routify.dev/
SMUI: https://sveltematerialui.com/

Setup steps:
    1. run `npm install` in project directory
    2. now and every other time you install a new SMUI component, run `npm run build:smui`
    3. run `npm run dev` and navigate to https://localhost:8080
    
    
  Code is not great, a lot of refactoring needed, first project with svelte.
